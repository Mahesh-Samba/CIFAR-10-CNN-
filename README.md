# CIFAR-10-CNN-

Certainly! Here's a project summary using "I":

### Project Summary:
I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images categorized into 10 classes. The CNN architecture included three convolutional layers followed by max pooling, with additional dense layers and dropout for regularization. I trained the model using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and categorical cross-entropy loss function. After 20 epochs of training with a batch size of 128, I achieved a test accuracy of approximately 70-80%. Visualizing the training history revealed a progressive increase in both training and validation accuracy, while the loss decreased consistently over epochs. This project provided hands-on experience in building and optimizing CNNs for image classification tasks, leveraging the capabilities of TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
